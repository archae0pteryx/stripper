# Javascript Comment stripper
### Strip comments from any js file for a clearer mind.
#### Currently this won't strip comments that are inline.

Q: Why?
A: Because you wrote too many useless comments... QUIT.

usage:

```chmod +x stripper.sh```

```./stripper.sh test.js```

to install globally (assuming /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH)

```chmod +x stripper.sh && cp stripper.sh /usr/local/bin/stripper```

then re-source your shell. Use wherever.
